# Data Structure Implementation Report

## Date: 2025-01-25
## Agent: Data Structure Agent

### Overview
Successfully created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and mock data for the KrankenkassenAssistent project based on the Swiss health insurance system.

### Created Files

#### 1. Type Definitions (`/src/types/`)
- **user.ts**: User profile interfaces including personal info, health status, preferences
- **insurance.ts**: Insurance provider and product interfaces (basic & supplementary)
- **calculation.ts**: Calculation request/result interfaces for premium comparisons
- **chat.ts**: Chat session and conversation flow interfaces
- **index.ts**: Central export file for all types

#### 2. Mock Data (`/src/data/`)
- **providers.ts**: 10 major Swiss insurance providers with detailed company information
- **basicInsurance.ts**: 24 basic insurance products across different models (Standard, Telmed, HMO, Hausarzt, Apotheken)
- **supplementaryInsurance.ts**: 19 supplementary insurance products (ambulant, hospital, dental, etc.)
- **packages.ts**: 15 insurance packages with bundle discounts
- **mockUsers.ts**: 5 diverse user profiles for testing
- **chatTemplates.ts**: Multilingual chat templates (DE, FR, IT, EN) for conversation flows
- **index.ts**: Central export with helper functions and aggregated data

### Key Data Structures

#### User Profile
- Personal information (name, age, location)
- Health status and pre-existing conditions
- Family and employment situation
- Insurance preferences
- Current insurance details

#### Insurance Products
- **Basic Insurance**: Different models with canton/age-based pricing
- **Supplementary Insurance**: Various categories (ambulant, hospital, dental, etc.)
- **Packages**: Bundled products with discounts

#### Pricing Models
- Canton-specific factors (Geneva most expensive, Uri/Appenzell cheapest)
- Age-based pricing tiers
- Franchise discounts (up to 38% for 2500 CHF franchise)
- Model discounts (up to 25% for HMO)

### Mock Data Statistics
- **Providers**: 10 (CSS, Helsana, SWICA, Visana, Concordia, Sanitas, Atupri, Assura, Groupe Mutuel, KPT)
- **Basic Insurance Products**: 24 (covering all 5 model types)
- **Supplementary Products**: 19 (across 6 categories)
- **Insurance Packages**: 15 (with 4-15% bundle discounts)
- **User Profiles**: 5 (diverse demographics and needs)
- **Cantons Covered**: All 26 Swiss cantons

### Features Implemented
1. **Realistic Pricing**: Based on actual Swiss insurance market patterns
2. **Age-based Calculations**: Different pricing tiers for children, young adults, and adults
3. **Canton Variations**: Reflects real cost differences across regions
4. **Model Discounts**: Accurate discount ranges for different insurance models
5. **Comprehensive Coverage Types**: All major supplementary insurance categories
6. **Multilingual Support**: Templates in 4 languages (DE, FR, IT, EN)

### Data Relationships
- Providers → Products (1:many)
- Products → Pricing (1:many based on canton/age)
- Users → Preferences → Recommendations
- Basic + Supplementary → Packages (with discounts)

### Helper Functions
- `getProviderById()`: Retrieve provider with all products
- `getProductsByProvider()`: Get all products for a provider
- `cantonNames`: Human-readable canton names
- `insuranceModelDescriptions`: Detailed model explanations

### Next Steps for Other Agents
1. **Frontend Agent**: Use these types and mock data for UI components
2. **Chat Agent**: Implement conversation logic using chat templates
3. **Calculation Agent**: Build premium calculation logic using pricing data
4. **Integration Agent**: Connect data structures with API endpoints

### Technical Notes
- All TypeScript interfaces are properly typed and exported
- Mock data follows realistic Swiss insurance market patterns
- Pricing calculations consider multiple factors (age, canton, franchise, model)
- Data is structured for easy filtering and searching
- Multilingual support built into chat templates

This comprehensive data structure provides a solid foundation for building the KrankenkassenAssistent application with realistic Swiss health insurance data.
