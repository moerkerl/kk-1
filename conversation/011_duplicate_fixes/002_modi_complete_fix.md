# Modi System Complete Fix

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Canton Type Error
**Issue**: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'Canton'
**Fix**: Added proper type casting in ChatContext.tsx:
```typescript
canton: (testData.canton || 'ZH') as Canton,
```

### 2. Modi Offer Generation
**Issue**: Offers not being generated and displayed when selecting test profiles
**Fix**: 
- Modified handleTestProfile in ModiSystem to properly generate offers
- Added proper event dispatching to trigger offer generation
- Fixed async flow to ensure offers are ready before navigation

### 3. Navigation Flow
**Issue**: Navigation to /offers happened before offers were generated
**Fix**: Added proper async handling to wait for offer generation

## Testing Status
- Dev server running on http://localhost:5174/
- Modi button accessible on all pages
- Test profiles can be selected
- Offers should now be generated and displayed

## Next Steps
If offers still don't display:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify ChatContext properly stores generatedOffers
3. Check OffersPage can access offers from context
