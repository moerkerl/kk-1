# Modi System Navigation Fix

## Problem Description
When clicking a test profile in the Modi System, users were seeing an empty /chat page with only the title "Krankenkassen-Assistent" instead of being redirected to /offers with generated offers.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the ModiSystem component. When a test profile was clicked:
1. It called `resetChat()` which cleared all messages
2. It dispatched the test data event
3. It called `goToStep('generating-offers')`
4. The ChatContext listener was receiving the event and generating offers correctly
5. However, the user remained on the /chat page

The ChatContext had proper logic to handle test data, generate offers, and navigate to /offers, but the ModiSystem was interfering by calling `goToStep()` after dispatching the event.

## Solution
The fix involves removing the `goToStep('generating-offers')` call from ModiSystem.tsx since the ChatContext already handles the entire flow when it receives the test data event.

## Changes Made

### 1. ModiSystem.tsx
- Removed the `goToStep('generating-offers')` call after dispatching the test data event
- The component now only resets the chat and dispatches the test data event
- The ChatContext handles all the logic for generating offers and navigation

### Before:
```typescript
const applyTestProfile = (profile: TestProfile) => {
  // Reset chat first
  resetChat();
  
  // Apply test data
  const mockEvent = new CustomEvent('apply-test-data', { 
    detail: profile.data 
  });
  window.dispatchEvent(mockEvent);
  
  // Jump to a later step in the chat flow
  goToStep('generating-offers');
  
  setIsOpen(false);
};
```

### After:
```typescript
const applyTestProfile = (profile: TestProfile) => {
  // Reset chat first
  resetChat();
  
  // Apply test data - ChatContext will handle the rest
  const mockEvent = new CustomEvent('apply-test-data', { 
    detail: profile.data 
  });
  window.dispatchEvent(mockEvent);
  
  setIsOpen(false);
};
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. User clicks test profile in Modi System
2. Chat is reset
3. Test data event is dispatched
4. ChatContext receives the event and:
   - Updates the collected data with test profile data
   - Generates insurance offers based on the test data
   - Navigates immediately to /offers page
5. User sees the offers page with generated offers displayed

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Open the application
2. Click the Modi System button (settings icon) in bottom right
3. Select any test profile
4. Verify immediate redirect to /offers page
5. Verify offers are displayed correctly based on test profile data

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a loading state during the transition
- Add error handling if offer generation fails
- Consider preserving some chat history for context
